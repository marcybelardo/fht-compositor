//! Inter-process communication for `fht-compositor`
//!
//! ## Interacting with the IPC
//!
//! There are three ways to interact the IPC:
//!
//! 1. Use the `fht-compositor cli` command line, which is a CLI wrapper around method number 2.
//!    Useful for writing scripts with the `-j/--json` flag or querying information and have a nice
//!    (but unstable) output.
//!
//! 2. Make programmatic use of the IPC, which gives types to use with [`serde`]. You should open up
//!    a [`UnixStream`] with [`connect`] and serialize/deserialize your requests to/from JSON.
//!
//! 3. Make use of tools like [socat](//www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) with [jq](https://jqlang.org/)
//!    for more thorough scripting purposes or just use whatever your favourite language has to
//!    offer for Unix socket communication.
//!
//! ## Using the IPC
//!
//! When it comes to **using** the IPC, you can query some information using [`Request`] and
//! get out a [`Response`].
//!
//! **TODO**: Event stream
